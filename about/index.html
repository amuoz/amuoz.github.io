  <h1>About me</h1>

  

  <p><img src="/images/yo_raynor_banner.png" alt="Necrognomicon"></p>
<p>Hi folks! My name is <strong>Antonio Muñoz</strong>. I&rsquo;m from Murcia, Spain.</p>
<p>I can visualize my whole life through names of videogames. I think the best way to know me better is to take a journey through all those games that are part of who I am. Let&rsquo;s learn videogame history!</p>
<p>All started at my grandfather&rsquo;s electronic shop. He was selling fridges, stereos, washing machines and so on. One day a strange black box appeared in the shop, it was the SEGA Master System with <strong>Alex Kidd</strong>. Why was I being able to move the character in the TV? My mind literally exploded that day. Alex Kidd was made in 1987, the same year I was born.</p>
<p>Not much later I started playing floppy disc games in MS-DOS on my father&rsquo;s computer. I still remember <strong>Commander Keen</strong> and <strong>Duke Nukem</strong>, such master pieces.</p>
<p>Soon came <strong>Sonic</strong> the hedgehog, my chilhood favourite game. Since Sonic I have a special attachment to platform games genre. I became a SEGA fan.</p>
<p>Then, my uncle started to bring computer games. <strong>Wolfenstein 3D</strong>. I was amazed seeing a 3D world, it felt so realistic! Then <strong>DOOM</strong>. Omfg what was that!! All those monsters, the effects, everything was impresive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mandatory for me to talk about <strong>Quake</strong>. I still remember launching the LAN cable into the air through the window to play coop with my cousin that was living next to me.</p>
<p>Then <strong>Age of Empires</strong> was installed at my uncle&rsquo;s computer. At that time I had only played games where I controlled a single unit so I was pretty shocked moving an entire army! Mining resources, building defenses, researching upgrades..such depth!</p>
<p>After that I ended up with a demo copy of <strong>Starcraft</strong>, just a couple of campaign missions, but I falled in love of that speed of gameplay. BEST RTS game ever made! I continue playing competitive <strong>Starcraft 2</strong> nowadays in case you want to play ^^.</p>
<p>A cybercafé opened in my town and I played <strong>Half life</strong> for the first time there. Half life felt different from minute one thanks to it&rsquo;s narrative. It wasn&rsquo;t just killing enemies, it had an intriguing story behind it. My favourite FPS no doubt.</p>
<p>Years later I was deciding about my university career. I wanted to make videogames so I decided to study <em>Computer Science</em>. I met a lot of my closest friends there, it was awesome to study with people with the same interests and hobbies.</p>
<p>I started working as web developer, I knew I would like it because I did some money developing web pages with Flash and PHP when I was younger. I have spent approximately six years developing web servers with Java as well as SQL data bases for public administration. But I always had videogames development in the back of my mind. I saved money along those years waiting the moment to change, it came late but it finally came.</p>
<p><strong>Now?</strong> I&rsquo;m currently living in Madrid. I have attended a videogame programming master&rsquo;s degree at <em>Complutense University</em> and I&rsquo;m looking for a job as game programmer. It&rsquo;s time to contribute to videogame industry, put my skills at its service and make other people feel the same way I have felt.</p>
<p>I had so much to tell that I ended up writing a full <em>About me</em> extended in my Gnome guts blog. <a href="https://muoz.dev/posts/about-me-extended/">If you want to read more check it out here!</a></p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed the reading! :D</p>
